<body>
The following links demonstrate how one can set up a canvas element to better
adapt to the client display and browser.
<ul>
	<li><a href="retina.html">Retina displays:</a> demonstrates the
	difference between a canvas that is adapted to retina displays versus
	one that is not.</li>
	<li><a href="scale.html">Viewport scaling:</a> demonstrates how one can
	scale a canvas to fill the viewport while maintaining a fixed aspect
	ratio.
	<li><a href="animate.html">Efficient animation:</a> demonstrates how one
	can animate a canvas so that system resources are not wasted when the
	webpage is not in view. The canvas is also resized as the viewport
	dimensions change. This webpage also decouples the animation callback
	from the time-based state changes (e.g. physics updates).</li>
